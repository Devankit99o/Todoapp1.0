      <h3>Increases productivity </h3>
      <div style={{ textAlign: "justify"  }}>
        At work and at home, having a to-do list may help you prioritize your
        work and personal tasks. This allows you to organize and complete the
        most crucial tasks first. To-do lists can be used to improve time
        management because all of your tasks are laid out clearly in advance.
        You can more easily decide what to do after you complete a task and move
        on to the next item on the list.

      <h3>Provides motivation </h3>
      <div style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
        Too many tasks to remember can be overwhelming, but with the proper
        motivation, you can accomplish more and reduce stress. Having a to-do
        list makes it easier to organize everything that you want to accomplish
        in the day so that you can start fresh the next. Physically crossing
        items off a list can also increase motivation. Being unmotivated can
        make you less likely to complete items on your to-do list. Finding
        intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is important. Intrinsic motivation is
        an internal source of encouragement. For example, a bookworm might
        finish a novel because they love reading and not because they have to do
        it for an assignment. Extrinsic motivation is an outside source that
        inspires you. An example of this is cleaning the house because coworkers
        are visiting for a business dinner. Thinking about your intrinsic and
        extrinsic sources of motivation can help you plan out how to complete
        tasks.

      <h3> Improves memory</h3>
      <div style={{ textAlign: "" }}>
        Creating and maintaining a daily to-do list can help improve your
        overall memory by reinforcing your short-term memory. By writing tasks
        and short-term goals and continually checking the list, you might retain
        more information. Making a list every day can improve memory and may
        assist you in making sure all your important tasks get completed on
        time.

      <h3> Reduces anxiety and improves mental health</h3>
      <div>
        Being able to reduce anxiety is an important part of a balanced life.
        Organizing your schedule with a to-do list can improve your mental
        health by resolving uncertainty and allowing you to see all the
        activities you plan to accomplish throughout the day. The act of
        completing tasks can also provide an ego boost, reassuring you of your
        capabilities. The satisfaction of checking a task off your list and
        moving toward a new goal can increase your self-confidence. Having
        higher self-esteem can improve your overall mental health and provide a
        better outlook on life.

      <h3>Set deadlines for each goal</h3>
      <div style={{ textAlign: "" }}>
        Putting time limits on a task can establish boundaries and may turn the
        goal from an idea into a more concrete task. Without limits, there is
        nothing to stop you from procrastinating and continually pushing back
        the completion of the task. Before beginning, take five to 10 minutes to
        think about how you might start and complete your objective. As a part
        of this planning process, look at all the aspects involved with the task
        and set a realistic timeframe. Do your best to respect that time limit
        without pushing the deadline.

      <h3>Divide larger tasks </h3>
      <div style={{ textAlign: "" }}>
        Sometimes bigger tasks can seem daunting and stressful. The best action
        you can take is to divide the larger goals into smaller chunks that are
        easier to complete. By dividing a large task, you're setting small
        milestones. This approach can help you identify all the elements
        involved in more minor tasks, giving you a clearer view of all the
        activities related to the project. For instance, if your goal is to
        clean the entire house, then instead of writing "clean the house" on the
        list, break the task into specific parts, such as cleaning the kitchen,
        the living room, and the bedroom. This can make the task seem more
        manageable and might help you eliminate stress.
